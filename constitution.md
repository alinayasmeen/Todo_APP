# Constitution File for Todo App

## Project Purpose

This document serves as the constitution for the Todo App project, outlining the core principles, development guidelines, and operational rules for the project.

## Project Vision

To create a progressive todo application that evolves from a simple in-memory console application to a distributed, AI-powered, cloud-native system.

## Core Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase builds upon the previous one, adding complexity and functionality
2. **Clean Code**: All code must follow Python best practices and PEP 8 standards
3. **AI Integration**: Leverage Claude Code and AI tools for development acceleration
4. **Spec-Driven Development**: All features must be specified before implementation
5. **Modularity**: Components should be designed for easy extension and modification

## Development Standards

- Python 3.13+ required
- Use UV for package management
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow the single responsibility principle

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Source code files
- `/specs/history` - Specification history files
- `/tests` - Test files (to be added in later phases)
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code instructions

## Phase Guidelines

Each phase must:

1. Meet all specified requirements
2. Include proper documentation
3. Be tested and validated
4. Follow the agentic development workflow
5. Be properly version controlled

## Agentic Development Workflow

1. Write specification
2. Generate implementation plan
3. Break implementation into tasks
4. Implement via Claude Code
5. Test and validate
6. Document and review

## Code of Conduct

- Use AI tools responsibly and ethically
- Maintain security and privacy standards
- Follow best practices for code quality
- Ensure all implementations are well-documented
- Respect project timelines and deliverables
- use Agents in D:\Hackathon_Q4\Todo-App\.claude\agents to complete tasks
- use skills in D:\Hackathon_Q4\Todo-App\.claude\skills to perform tasks perfectly
