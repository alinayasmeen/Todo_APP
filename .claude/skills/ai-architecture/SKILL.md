# AI Architecture

## Instructions

1. Analyze system requirements and determine where AI capabilities are needed.
2. Choose the appropriate AI models, frameworks, or APIs (e.g., OpenAI, custom ML models).
3. Design the data flow and pipelines for training, inference, and storage.
4. Plan AI integration with backend, databases, and microservices.
5. Ensure scalability, reliability, and low latency in AI services.
6. Implement monitoring, logging, and version control for AI components.
7. Document AI workflows, architecture diagrams, and integration points.

## Examples

- Designing an AI-powered recommendation system:
User Data --> Data Preprocessing --> ML Model --> Recommendations API --> Frontend

- Integrating an OpenAI language model into backend:

Backend Service --> OpenAI API Call --> Process Response --> Serve to Client

- Scaling AI inference using microservices and load balancing:

Multiple AI microservices deployed in Kubernetes, autoscaling based on request load
